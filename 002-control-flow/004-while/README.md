When while will be used:
You don’t know how many pages you’ll check
You stop when a condition is met
Loop depends on state, not count

for	- I know how many times
while - I don’t know when it will stop

while (condition) {
  // code to run
  // update statement
}

while (condition) {
  statement;
  i++;
}


let i = 0;

while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
