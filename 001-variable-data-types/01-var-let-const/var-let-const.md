### `var`, `let`, `const` — **Topics Only**

* Variable declaration

* Variable initialization

* `var`

  * Function scope
  * Hoisting
  * Re-declaration allowed (var a = 5; var a = 10;)
  * Re-assignment allowed (var a = 5; a = 10; )

  Re-assignment ≠ Redeclaration
Term	Meaning	Example
Re-assignment	Changing value	x = 20
Redeclaration	Declaring again	let x = 20

* `let`

  * Block scope
  * Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)
  * No re-declaration
  * Re-assignment allowed

* `const`

  * Block scope
  * Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)
  * No re-declaration
  * No re-assignment
  * Mutability of objects and arrays

* Scope comparison (`var` vs `let` vs `const`)

* Hoisting behavior comparison

* Best practices (`let` vs `const`)

* When to avoid `var`
