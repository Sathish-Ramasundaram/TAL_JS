# 📘 JavaScript 

## 🧠 Project Objective
This repository documents your hands-on journey through **core JavaScript concepts**, each backed by a **tiny demo project** to reinforce understanding. It’s designed to help beginners grasp not just theory, but how each concept behaves in real code.

### ✅ `002-control-flow/`
Covers decision-making logic:
- `001-if-else` — Conditional branching

## Newly added 21-January

- `003-for` — `for` loop basics with examples
- `004-while` — `while` loop and use cases
- `005-do-while` — `do...while` loop behavior
- `006-break` — Exiting loops early
- `007-continue` — Skipping iterations
- `008-for-in` — Iterating over object keys
