# 📘 JavaScript 

## 🧠 Project Objective
This repository documents your hands-on journey through **core JavaScript concepts**, each backed by a **tiny demo project** to reinforce understanding. It’s designed to help beginners grasp not just theory, but how each concept behaves in real code.

### ✅ `002-control-flow/`
Covers decision-making logic:
- `001-if-else` — Conditional branching
- `002-switch` — Multi-path control with switch-case

## ✅ `004-objects-arrays/`

Hands-on practice with JavaScript reference data structures:

## ✅ `005-DOM/`

Covers **core DOM (Document Object Model) concepts** with focused mini demos:

### 📁 `001-Intro-selecting-Elements/`

* Understanding the DOM structure
* Selecting elements using:

  * `getElementById`
  * `querySelector`
  * `querySelectorAll`
* Difference between single element vs NodeList

---

### 📁 `002-Read-Update-Content/`

* Reading content using `textContent`
* Updating content dynamically
* Understanding `innerHTML` and when to avoid it
* Safe vs unsafe DOM updates

---

### 📁 `004-styling-class/`

* Styling elements using JavaScript
* Using `classList.add`, `classList.remove`, `classList.toggle`
* Best practices for class-based styling
* Basic usage of inline styles via `style`

---

### 📁 `005-Events/`

Demonstrates **event handling** with multiple examples:

* `click.html` — Handling click events
* `keydown.html` — Keyboard event handling
* `mouseover.html` — Mouse interaction events
* Understanding:

  * `addEventListener`
  * Common DOM events
  * Event object and `event.target`

---

### 📁 `006-Event-Flow/`

* Understanding how events flow through the DOM
* Event bubbling (default behavior)
* Event capturing
* Using `stopPropagation`
* Real-world examples showing why bubbling is important
